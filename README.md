    Hi,

    Thanks for checking out this project, which has been built using React and Redux.

    The idea behind this app came about as I was studying for the JLPT exam, and I 
    wanted to have a centralized place where I could store grammar points, vocab, etc. 
    that I need to work on. 

    I love programming and learning Japanese, so there was a perfect opportunity to 
    combine both.

    At the moment the app is still very basic, but I think there is a lot of space 
    for adding new features!
